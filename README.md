# Python-sql-Bi
First project to demostrate and work at extraction, cleaning, and transformation of data from the telecom churn dataset. 

The project is divided into three main stages:

- Python (EDA & Data Cleaning): Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), cleaned inconsistencies, and visualized distributions and correlations.

- SQL (Data Queries): Executed queries to extract specific insights useful for decision-making.

- Power BI (Dashboard): Designed an interactive dashboard to summarize and present the results in a business-friendly way.

Data Source: The dataset I'm going to use comes from Kaggle: http://kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets/data

The libraries used are the following:
Python:
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
