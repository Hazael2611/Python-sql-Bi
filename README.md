# Python-sql-Bi
First project to demostrate and work at extraction, cleaning, and transformation of data from the telecom churn dataset. Python was first used to perform the analysis and cleaning (EDA) of the data, followed by SQL queries to obtain specific information for decision-making and to better understand the dataset. Finally, POWER BI was used to create a dashboard to present the results


Data Source: The dataset I'm going to use comes from Kaggle: http://kaggle.com/datasets/mnassrib/telecom-churn-datasets/data

The libraries used are the following:
* Pandas
* Numpy 
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
